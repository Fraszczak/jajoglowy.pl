1. Meeting the customer's expectations by delivering valuable software as quickly as possible is paramount.

2. Changes in requirements are natural, we treat them with understanding. When working on an agile project, we must devote time to maintaining the appropriate flexibility of the structure through the use of appropriate practices, rules, and design patterns.

3. Working software should be delivered as soon as possible.

4. The business side must constantly cooperate with development teams.

5. The necessary work environment, support and trust for development teams is the most important. Processes or management are secondary matters adjusted to the needs.

6. The most effective form of communicating information is face-to-face conversation.

7. The measure of the project's progress is the number of functionalities that meet the client's expectations.

8. The project is not a sprint, it is more of a marathon. You should not try to get the highest possible performance from the start.

9. The constant attention to technological excellence has a positive impact on the agility of the project. High quality is the key to high performance.

10. The key is the simplicity of solutions, making small steps.

11. The source of the best architecture, specification or design in general are teams that have been given a free hand in terms of self-organization. The team should decide how to perform the work most efficiently, and the entire team should be responsible for tasks such as creating an architect, defining requirements or testing.

12. At regular intervals, the team involved in software development should analyze and improve the way it works.
